Leftover Love is a hyperlocal food-sharing platform that helps reduce household and business food waste by connecting surplus groceries with people experiencing food insecurity — in real time, before expiry.

Users can log extra food items (along with expiry dates) through our intuitive web interface. When an item nears its expiration, the platform notifies the user and displays the item on a live map, allowing nearby food seekers to view and claim it. If the item goes unclaimed, it can be redirected to a community fridge or compost partner — and the user earns “Soil Credits” that can be redeemed at partnering grocery stores.

This isn’t just about preventing waste — it’s about turning everyday generosity into a sustainable system of nourishment and reward.

We started with a simple but urgent question: “Why does so much edible food get thrown away while so many people go hungry?”

When we discovered that most household food waste happens because food is forgotten in the fridge or pantry — not because it’s inedible — we knew the solution needed to be both timely and local. Our team members have volunteered at food banks and student-run community fridges, so we’ve seen firsthand the logistical challenges of getting food to those who need it.

Leftover Love was born out of a desire to make food-sharing effortless and smart — leveraging expiry dates, geolocation, and community-based micro incentives.

Working with a small team of just 3 people meant juggling design, development, and testing all at once — under intense time pressure. Balancing speed with functionality was the toughest part for us.
